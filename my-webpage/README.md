# My Webpage

This project is a simple static webpage that mimics a terminal session. The webpage is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

The webpage provides an interface where users can input commands. Depending on the command entered, the webpage will display different results. For example, if the user types "whois", it will display information about the website owner. If the user types "socials", it will display links to the website owner's social media profiles. If the user types "projects", it will display information about the website owner's projects.

The webpage uses the Nord color palette to give it the appearance of a terminal session. There is also a blinking cursor in the input area to indicate where the user can type.

## Instructions

To use the webpage, simply type a command into the input area and press enter. The webpage will then display the result of the command.

## Code

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.

- `css/styles.css`: This file contains all the CSS styles for the webpage. It uses the Nord color palette to style the webpage and includes styles for a blinking cursor in the input area.

- `js/script.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the user's input commands and displays the appropriate results.

## Future Improvements

Future improvements to this project could include adding more commands for the user to input, improving the responsiveness of the webpage, and enhancing the visual design of the webpage.
